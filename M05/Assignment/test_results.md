### To me, the test results are a more curated error message that is based on the way the user wants to see it. This can be very useful when trying to debug, but it is especially useful throughout the entire coding process to prevent bugs from getting through the cracks. Unit Testing goes well with larger group based projects where all code needs to be vetted by a central, predetermined source.
