# Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called seconds_per_day.

# Establishing the variables
SECONDS_IN_MINUTE = 60
MINUTES_IN_HOUR = 60
HOURS_IN_DAY = 24

# Completing the operation
seconds_per_hour = SECONDS_IN_MINUTE * MINUTES_IN_HOUR

# Completing the operation
seconds_per_day = seconds_per_hour * HOURS_IN_DAY

# Printing Results
print(seconds_per_day)
