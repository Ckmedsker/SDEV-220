# Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable
# called seconds_per_hour.

# Establishing the variables
SECONDS_IN_MINUTE = 60
MINUTES_IN_HOUR = 60

# Completing the operation and printing
seconds_per_hour = SECONDS_IN_MINUTE * MINUTES_IN_HOUR

# Printing results
print(seconds_per_hour)
